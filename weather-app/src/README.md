The weather app is best used in mobile format so, in the browser have a width of 768px however, it is responsive to standard desktop size.

When launching the weather app, the default location is Cape Town in South Africa. To change location, just search a location in the search box and press seach. Any location can be used for the main page and the wind page but there is a restriction on the API for the wave page to only allow coastal locations. If a location is not valid for the wave page, the places where API data would appear as 'Not a valid location'. To solve this issue, go back to the main page and search for a coastal location.
